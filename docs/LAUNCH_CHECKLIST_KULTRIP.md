# Kultrip Launch Checklist (Essential MVP)

## 1. Data Integration & Quality
- [ ] Replace all mock data with real database queries for activities, destinations, users, preferences.
- [ ] Ensure activities are filtered by user travel dates and actual availability.
- [ ] Prevent duplicates; each itinerary slot must have a unique activity.

## 2. API Security & Robustness
- [ ] Validate user tokens/authentication for all requests.
- [ ] Gracefully handle missing/invalid data, empty results, and any API errors.
- [ ] Log all API errors and important events for debugging and monitoring.

## 3. Localization
- [ ] Support multiple languages/locales for activities, descriptions, and UI.

## 4. Storytelling & UX Enrichment
- [ ] Enrich itinerary stories using activity context, fun facts, and/or LLMs for personalized, engaging narratives.

## 5. Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Track API usage, error rates, and (if possible) user conversions and major actions.

## 6. Documentation & Help
- [ ] Provide API docs for internal/external developers.
- [ ] Create basic user guides, onboarding instructions, and help documentation for platform users.
